This MATLAB script processes multiple TIF images from a user-selected folder, extracts a region of interest (ROI) from each image, and calculates the average intensity for the selected region. The images are displayed in a grid of subplots with their respective filenames as titles. The script sorts the images based on their average intensities and calculates the approximate f-numbers for each image, with know fully open aperture intensity and a known default f-number (f/1.4).
